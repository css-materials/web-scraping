# EXTRACT MOVIE INFORMATION FROM IMDb - EXAMPLE USING FROZEN


# Read in R the Frozen html page (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/)
# Store it in an object called `frozen`


# Select the nodes that are both `a`s and `id = "titleCast"`


# Extract the text from the nodes


# Use SelectorGadget to find a CSS selector combination that
# identifies just the cast member names


# Clean up text (use strigr, see regex lecture)
